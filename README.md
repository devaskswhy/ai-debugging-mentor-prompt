# ai-debugging-mentor-prompt
This repository contains a refined system prompt that turns an AI into a non-revealing Python debugging mentor, designed to build student skill through hints, micro-experiments, and adaptive depth.  It enforces a strict “hints-not-solutions” rule, ensures a clear structure, and scales support from beginner to advanced learners.
